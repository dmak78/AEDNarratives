## Current Issues

Although elephant conservation and monitoring started in Angola after the end of the civil war in 2002, it has concentrated largely in the south-east of the country. A detailed nationwide study of elephant distribution and density is urgently required. Threats include poaching, illegal wildlife trade, human population expansion and settlement together with subsistence agriculture, fire and logging activities. There are weak incentives for elephant conservation and law enforcement is poor due to limited staff and capacity.

Wildlife legislation in Angola is limited largely due to the challenges of rebuilding administrative and governmental infrastructure after decades of conflict. Angola published an elephant conservation plan in 1991, although this is now seriously out of date (Instituto de Desenvolvimento Florestal, 1991). The development of a new plan was underway as of June 2016. 

A study in Luanda in 2006 (Milliken et al., 2006) exposed a large and unregulated domestic ivory market in Luanda and eight years later this market was still flourishing with over 10,000 recently carved and illegal ivory items reported (Svensson et al., 2014; Vigne & Martin, 2014). It is believed that the majority of this ivory comes from forest elephants in countries such as the DRC. The increased demand for worked ivory was believed to be linked to the rising number of Chinese citizens working in Angola.

In recent analyses of seizure data in ETIS, prepared for CITES, Angola has been identified as a country with a worrying involvement in illegal ivory trade (CITES Secretariat, 2012; Milliken et al., 2013, 2016). Angola, a Party to CITES since 2013, was requested by the CITES Standing Committee to prepare a National Ivory Action Plan which it submitted in February 2015 (CITES, n.d.-a). Commencing in May 2016, the Government of Angola enacted a ban on domestic trade of ivory (Hungerford, 2016).

## Numbers and Distribution

The estimated number of elephants in areas surveyed in the last ten years in Angola is 3,396 ± 1,562 at the time of the last survey for each area. There may be an additional 96 to 111 elephants in areas not systematically surveyed in Angola. These guesses likely represent a minimum number, and actual numbers could be higher than those reported. Together, this estimate and guess apply to 41,847 km², which is 13% of the estimated known and possible elephant range. There remains an additional 87% of the estimated range for which no elephant population estimates are available.

The national totals show an increase of nearly 2,000 in estimated numbers. However, this is a result of a larger proportion of the main elephant population being covered than in earlier surveys, rather than a real increase.

Elephants are believed to be present in the far north and far south of the country, with forest elephants in the north-west and savanna elephants in the north-east and south (Enock, pers. comm., 2002), although the genetic status  of these elephants has not been confirmed.

In 2015 an **aerial sample count** survey was carried out between the Kwando and Cuito-Kavango rivers in the south-east of Angola (Chase & Schlossberg, 2016). Elephants in this area form part of the KAZA transboundary population. The survey gave an overall estimate of 3,396 ± 1,562 elephants. This replaced an estimate of 1,827 ± 598 from the Luiana Partial Reserve in 2005 (Chase & Griffin, 2011). The 2015 survey expanded the range covered to include Cubango Game Reserve in the west and Mavinga on the Kwando to the north (though no elephants were sighted there). Data extracted by Chase and Schlossberg (Chase & Schlossberg, 2016) from their 2015 dataset for Luiana PR only, provided a comparable estimate of 1,437 ± 600 elephants, which although lower than the 2005 results, was not significantly so. The overall carcass ratio from the 2015 survey was 30%, suggesting a high level of mortality.

Thirty two elephants from South Africa were introduced to the Quiçama National Park by the Kissama Foundation in 2000 and 2001 and put into a 10,000-hectare, fenced, “soft release” area in the north of the park. In a 2015 survey 89 elephants were counted in the release area (Carmignani, 2015), and there were believed to be another 50 individuals in the rest of the park in 2002 (Vaz Pinto, pers. comm., 2003). 

There is a small population of perhaps 10-25 elephants living on the escarpment to the east of Luanda in the Kambondo forest (Hines, pers. comm. 2015) and sightings of these elephants are marked as point records.

Reports were received in 2012 of more than 20 elephants moving across the border from Angola, spending time in the south-western part of Congo (Mbende et al., 2012) and this area is marked as **known range**. 

In the AESR 2007 there was an estimate of 60 elephants in the Bongola area on the Namibia border from 1992, but since this is no longer marked as elephant range, it has been removed and this is recorded as a **lost population**. 

There is also a small area of elephant range in the Cabinda Enclave, a separate section of Angola surrounded by DRC and the Republic of Congo (Heffernan, 2005) but there is no estimate for this area.

Substantial changes have been made to the range map (Vaz Pinto & Verissimo, pers. comm., 2014). These include the removal of a large area of **possible range** in the dry south-west part of the country, the addition of a new area of **possible range** on the Zambian border, and a more defined range, including some **known range**, both east of Luanda and on the border with the DRC.
